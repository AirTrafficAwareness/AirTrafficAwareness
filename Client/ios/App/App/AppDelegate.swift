/// Does a best effort attempt to trigger the local network privacy alert.

/// It works by sending a UDP datagram to the discard service (port 9) of every
/// IP address associated with a broadcast-capable interface. This should
/// trigger the local network privacy alert, assuming the alert hasn’t already
/// been displayed for this app.
///
/// This code takes a ‘best effort’. It handles errors by ignoring them. As
/// such, there’s guarantee that it’ll actually trigger the alert.
///
/// - note: iOS devices don’t actually run the discard service. I’m using it
/// here because I need a port to send the UDP datagram to and port 9 is
/// always going to be safe (either the discard service is running, in which
/// case it will discard the datagram, or it’s not, in which case the TCP/IP
/// stack will discard it).
///
/// There should be a proper API for this (r. 69157424).
